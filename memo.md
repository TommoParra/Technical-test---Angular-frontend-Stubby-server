# Angular Technical Test - Project Summary and Feedback Memo

Dear Vueling Development Team,

Let me share with you my reflections and feedback on this Angular technical testapplication.

## Achievements and Insights:

### Application Responsiveness:

The application, while it lacks of fancy responsive features, prioritizes functionality over layout due to my limited experience with Angular. My focus was on delivering the required features, and I acknowledge the potential for improvement in the layout, which is typically my strength.

### Accessibility Features:

Beyond basic `aria-labels` and `alt` attributes, the application can benefit from additional accessibility features. I am open to incorporating more user-friendly accessibility elements and would appreciate guidance on specific improvements. It's a topic that I always wanted to and will learn.

### Testing Experience:

With limited experience in testing, the two basic tests conducted serve as an initial step. I am eager to deepen my understanding of unit testing and explore test-driven development methodologies for future projects.

### Login Functionality:

The login functionality relies on a hardcoded user due to encountering CORS issues during an atempt of mine of a more complex implementation. Despite the constraints, I prioritized crucial tasks.

### Guards and Interceptors:

The application features one guard and one interceptor, understanding that more intricate implementations are possible (and needed). I pursued an MVP approach for efficiency, but I am open to exploring advanced guard and interceptor configurations.

### CSS Encapsulation:

I acknowlede there's a lot of room for improvement in the CSS encapsulation system.

### Future Development Plans:

Given the chance, I would create a home page and transform the `airport-list` component into a reusable element, enhancing overall application structure and maintainability. Additionally, I know that the login session management should go beyond local storage.

## Personal Reflection:

I've been delivering complex layouts for more than 6 years now, but my journey with Angular has less than 1 year, but the more I use it, the more I love it.
I am dedicated to continuous learning and contributing positively to the team, and I want to share with you my enthusiasm for the opportunity to build my career at Vueling.
I hope to have the chance to discuss my application in an interview. I believe in the value I can bring to the team and the knowledge I can gain from being a part of Vueling.
I appreciate the opportunity to showcase my skills and contribute to the assessment process.
Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,

Tomas
